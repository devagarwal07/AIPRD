# AI-Powered PM Copilot - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product Name**: PM Copilot  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: September 2025  
**Owner**: Product Management Team  

PM Copilot is an AI-powered assistant specifically designed for Product Managers to accelerate and improve their core workflows around PRD creation, feature prioritization, and stakeholder collaboration. Rather than replacing PM judgment, it enhances decision-making through intelligent guidance, synthesis, and automation of routine tasks.

## How AI Accelerates (Not Replaces) PM Judgment

- PRD Completeness Score: Inline quality checks flag missing context, metrics, and risks so PMs decide what to add next.
- Suggestive Generators: Draft user stories and requirements derived from the problem/solution; PMs edit or discard.
- Prioritization Weights: Tunable Impact/Confidence/Effort weights surface trade-offs; PMs choose the cut.
- Synthesis Exports: One-click export of PRD, prioritization CSV, and stakeholder summaries to share and discuss.
- Persistence: Local drafts auto-save, enabling iterative PM workflows without losing context.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

Product Managers face significant challenges that consume 60-70% of their time on administrative and synthesis work rather than strategic thinking:

1. **PRD Creation Bottlenecks**: PMs spend 8-12 hours per PRD gathering requirements, structuring documents, and ensuring completeness. This often involves:
   - Starting from blank templates without guidance
   - Missing critical sections or requirements
   - Inconsistent documentation across teams
   - Multiple revision cycles due to incomplete initial drafts

2. **Prioritization Paralysis**: Feature prioritization involves complex trade-offs across multiple dimensions (impact, effort, confidence, business value) but PMs often lack:
   - Systematic frameworks for consistent evaluation
   - Data-driven scoring mechanisms
   - Clear visualization of trade-offs
   - Stakeholder alignment on priorities

3. **Stakeholder Coordination Overhead**: Managing input from engineering, design, sales, and customers requires:
   - Chasing feedback across multiple channels
   - Synthesizing conflicting opinions
   - Ensuring all voices are heard
   - Maintaining context across discussions

4. **Decision Fatigue**: PMs make hundreds of micro-decisions daily without systematic support for:
   - Best practice application
   - Historical decision context
   - Impact analysis
   - Learning from similar situations

### Impact Analysis

- **Time Cost**: Average PM spends 25+ hours/week on administrative tasks
- **Quality Issues**: 40% of PRDs require major revisions due to incomplete initial analysis
- **Opportunity Cost**: Strategic work (market analysis, user research, vision setting) gets deprioritized
- **Team Friction**: Poor coordination leads to misaligned expectations and rework
